Sign-in sheet for members/drop-ins at a sports club

This is a simple sign-in sheet for a sports club I work for. It can be used as a template for other similar sign-in sheets for sports clubs, gyms, etc. All the information from guests that sign in are stored in a .CSV file. A new .CSV file will be created on the server for each day. In this code I have the timing set to Pacific standard time.

Since the CSV folder contains the .CSV files that log the players for each day it's extrememly important that this folder is a protected directory. This is admin data that others should not be downloading and using. Your webhost should be able to provide you with this option.
